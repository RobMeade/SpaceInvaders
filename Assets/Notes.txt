After the rocket ship lands, the bottom two rows of invaders do not shoot (only tested on game 1)


RESEARCH:
	09/05
	Space invaders firing positions - bottom row appear to fire from left, middle and right.  Top row only from centre.

	12/05
	Space invaders fire only from the column closest to the player, in most cases the one above the player.  If the player
	is off to the extreme left or right then the left/right most column will fire.  

	Additionally, it's the closest invader that will fire, so if the invaders in the bottom two rows have been destroyed, the
	invader in the third row will be the invader that fires.

	11/07
	Does the number of remaining Invaders influence their rate of fire?

BUGS:
	02/05
	* BUG #15: If the CommandShip appears near the end of a wave and is destroyed, the abduction sequence begins with the CommandShip in its dying animation
			   and subsequently it disappears.  Need to consider either preventing the CommandShip from spawning when there are only a few invaders left, or
			   left the CommandShip fly off the screen before it comes back for the abduction.

	04/07
	* BUG #16: If two invaders get hit, seemingly at the same time, two destroyed sound fxs play almost simultaneously, this creates the effect of the volume being louder
			   Ideal solution here is to prevent two invaders being hit at the same time.  Check to see if the collision returns an array of items that it has hit, if so, effect just one.

	04/07
	* BUG #17: CommandShip should spawn only once per wave.  Once the 7th column of invaders has left the MotherShip it seems to appear.  
			   Remove random spawning ranges.  This may actually help to resolve Bug #15. 

	06/07
	* BUG #18: The last invader doesn't stop moving if another invader was killed very quickly before it.  This is because the count of invaders is still > 1 because
			   the previously hit invaders animation hasn't finished which calls the code to reduce the count.

	10/07
	* BUG #19: When the first column of invaders are destroyed quickly, the InvaderFormation changes direction and disappears off the screen.
			   When the first column of invaders are destroyed very quickly, as they are emerging from the mothership, the BoxCollider2D on the InvaderFormation resizes
			   and is no longer passed the first PlaySpaceBoundary, when it makes contact, the code then triggers the reverse direction call.
			   May need to consider a method of not activating the left PlaySpaceBoundary until all of the invaders have spawned/emerged.
			   This issue wasn't detected previously when the InvaderFormation velocity was higher as it was not possible to destroy all of the first column prior before
			   they made contact with the first PlaySpaceBoundary.

	11/07
	* BUG #25: Wave 8 completion, the player loses the ability to move/shoot, any projectiles already shot are frozen on the screen but do not cause collisions with the CommandShip.  
			   Once the player is respawned, these projectiles are cleared from the screen.


FEATURES:

	03/03
	* FEATURE #1: Could do with brief pause before lowering mothership (lock player controls?)



COMPLETED:

	25/03
	* BUG #10: The event which is triggered when the MotherShip descends is, by design, no longer raised once the MotherShip has landed, however, this event is being 
			   used to determine when to spawn the next InvaderFormation. 
			 T  he result of this is that no further InvaderFormations are spawned once the MotherShip has landed.

	27/03
	* BUG #4: Under a certain circumstance the InvaderFormation marches off the screen.  I think this is where the left/right most invader is destroyed, it 
		      plays the Destroyed animation and turns off the collider, I think this may be allowing the InvaderFormation to step over/passed the boundary which
		      would ordinarily send it moving in the opposite direction.  Needs testing.

	28/03
	* BUG #12: **Research** Does the player get respawned at a specific spawn position every life, or just where they were when they died?

	03/04
	* BUG #5: The rate of fire for invaders increases as they get closer to the planet as the only thing controlling when they can shoot next is whether a 
		    projectile is currently in play.  A minimum firing rate needs to be considered also.

	* BUG #11: Determine both Game Over conditions (out of lives / invaders landed) - break down what should happen under each condition, determine how to support both
			   with a tidy end game / ui

	06/04
	* FEATURE #3: Consider create a separate class for each event handler, deriving from a base class, which handles EventArgs.
				  All EventHandlers can then send references to sender and any arguments required.

	12/04
	* BUG #13: Player needs to be repositioned at its spawn point when mothership has completed its descent. Need to check whether this is the case after
			each wave is destroyed after the mothership has completed descended too.

	18/04
	* FEATURE #2: The CommandShip doesn't need to be "destroyed" when it reaches the shredder or is shot.  It could just reposition back off screen.  Instead of
				  randomising the spawning, I could just randomise when it moves. This would safe destroy/instantiating and object.

	24/04
	* FEATURE #4: Before start is pressed, the planet has "Space Invaders*" in the centre, with the scrolling text stating "(C) Copyright Atari 1980.  * Indicates TM of Taito America Corp."

	29/04
	* BUG #14: Replace all hard coded values across all classes with a reference to their property within the configuration class

	02/05
	* FEATURE #5: At the end of the 8th wave, the CommandShip comes down and takes your ship, need to check respawn position and any other effects of this feature (e.g. extra life?)

	12/05
	* FEATURE #9: Quit game (System Reset - darker brown)

	16/05
	* FEATURE #6: Sound FX - add basic sound effects for player explosion, invader explosion, command ship explosion, invader flying, command ship flying

	25/06
	* FEATURE #8: Invader formation movement speed - increases when invaders are reduced, first when the count reaches 24, second when the count reaches 12, 
				finally when the count reaches 1
				Need to research speed increases - consider recording video and using playback speed to calculate rate?

	06/07
	* FEATURE #7: Enhanced sound effects

	10/07
	* FEATURE #9: Invader animation speed - increases with the movement speed, same steps, 24, 12, and 1

	* FEATURE #7: Command ship explosion - slightly different sound

	16/07
	* BUG #26: End Game, when the player loses all of their lives the menu doesn't appear until the remaining invaders have landed on the planet.

	* BUG #24: When the player loses their last life, the CommandShip, if present, continues to fly off the screen but has no audio.  The invaders continue to march, but do not shoot, nor have any audio.

	* BUG #22: CommandShip stops moving when the InvaderFormation lands, but the CommandShip audio continues to play.  should the CommandShip still move off the screen (as it does when
			   the player dies) or, should it stop, but have the audio stop also.

	* BUG #20: InvaderFormation continues to play marching sound effect even when the player has been hit/destroyed.

	* BUG #21: InvaderFormation continues to animate when the player has been hit/destroyed.

	* BUG #23: Stutter sound effect is too quite.  The .ogg files may need to be normalised, alternatively, consider raising the volume of this effect.
