After the rocket ship lands, the bottom two rows of invaders do not shoot (only tested on game 1)


RESEARCH:
	09/05
	Space invaders firing positions - bottom row appear to fire from left, middle and right.  Top row only from centre.


Features (Summary):

* UI
  - Quit Game?

* Invaders movement speed-up
  - As the number of Invaders reduces, speed-up the movement
  - As the number of Invaders reduces, speed-up the animation
  - As the number of Invaders reduces, speed-up the firing rate

* Audio
  - Player explosion
  - Invader explosion - additional effect when the last invader is destroyed
  - Invader movement - tempo increases as invader count reduces
  - command ship explosion - slightly different sound
  - Command Ship flying - pitch changes for descent/ascent on play abduction

  - menu button click/tap


BUGS:
	02/05
	* BUG #15: If the CommandShip appears near the end of a wave and is destroyed, the abduction sequence begins with the CommandShip in its dying animation
			   and subsequently it disappears.  Need to consider either preventing the CommandShip from spawning when there are only a few invaders left, or
			   left the CommandShip fly off the screen before it comes back for the abduction.


FEATURES:

	03/03
	* FEATURE #1: Could do with brief pause before lowering mothership (lock player controls?)

	09/05
	* FEATURE #6: Sound FX - add basic sound effects for player explosion, invader explosion, command ship explosion, invader flying, command ship flying

	* FEATURE #7: Invader formation movement speed - increases when invaders are reduced, first when the count reaches 24, second when the count reaches 12, 
					finally when the count reaches 1
					Need to research speed increases - consider recording video and using playback speed to calculate rate?

	* FEATURE #8: Invader animation speed - increases with the movement speed, same steps, 24, 12, and 1

	* FEATURE #9: Quit game (System Reset - darker brown)

COMPLETED:

	25/03
	* BUG #10: The event which is triggered when the MotherShip descends is, by design, no longer raised once the MotherShip has landed, however, this event is being 
			   used to determine when to spawn the next InvaderFormation. 
			 T  he result of this is that no further InvaderFormations are spawned once the MotherShip has landed.

	27/03
	* BUG #4: Under a certain circumstance the InvaderFormation marches off the screen.  I think this is where the left/right most invader is destroyed, it 
		      plays the Destroyed animation and turns off the collider, I think this may be allowing the InvaderFormation to step over/passed the boundary which
		      would ordinarily send it moving in the opposite direction.  Needs testing.

	28/03
	* BUG #12: **Research** Does the player get respawned at a specific spawn position every life, or just where they were when they died?

	03/04
	* BUG #5: The rate of fire for invaders increases as they get closer to the planet as the only thing controlling when they can shoot next is whether a 
		    projectile is currently in play.  A minimum firing rate needs to be considered also.

	* BUG #11: Determine both Game Over conditions (out of lives / invaders landed) - break down what should happen under each condition, determine how to support both
			   with a tidy end game / ui

	06/04
	* FEATURE #3: Consider create a separate class for each event handler, deriving from a base class, which handles EventArgs.
				  All EventHandlers can then send references to sender and any arguments required.

	12/04
	* BUG #13: Player needs to be repositioned at its spawn point when mothership has completed its descent. Need to check whether this is the case after
			each wave is destroyed after the mothership has completed descended too.

	18/04
	* FEATURE #2: The CommandShip doesn't need to be "destroyed" when it reaches the shredder or is shot.  It could just reposition back off screen.  Instead of
				  randomising the spawning, I could just randomise when it moves. This would safe destroy/instantiating and object.

	24/04
	* FEATURE #4: Before start is pressed, the planet has "Space Invaders*" in the centre, with the scrolling text stating "(C) Copyright Atari 1980.  * Indicates TM of Taito America Corp."

	29/04
	* BUG #14: Replace all hard coded values across all classes with a reference to their property within the configuration class

	02/05
	* FEATURE #5: At the end of the 8th wave, the CommandShip comes down and takes your ship, need to check respawn position and any other effects of this feature (e.g. extra life?)
